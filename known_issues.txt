1) installed-rpms from sosreport is shown as invalid file
installed-rpms in root directory of extracted sos is symlink, select actual
file under sos_commands/rpm/ directory as workaround.
The bug is under consideration

2) Not accepting "%" in name of core or rpms directory path or file.
todo: "%" needs to be replaced with "%25" in web url, this can be considered
in future.
For now workaround is to rename file and make sure it does not have "%" symbol
anywhere in name or path.

3) Garbage text is seen while Install Packages step is about to finish

4) Install Packages and Install Debuginfo Packages buttons are enabled before
the earlier process being run is finished.

5) The tool fails silently without any error in case of problem installing any pacakge.
The tool uses yum to install required package. you does not provide any error code in return for package installation failure.
Hence its not possible to track this error. Make sure test system in question is registered and also subscribed to required child channels and debuginfo channels.
